Recording on vhs from your childhood blockbuster video store aka the aliased keystrokes thrift shop aka the Pro-Question Action League "a question's a question, no matter how small" aka the Land Before Rails aka the RegEx tattoo shop aka straight out the dungeons of code aka The crouching-tiger-hidden-semi-colon School aka The ruby-talk-pretty-one-day School aka The Flatiron School

<div style="float: right; padding-left: 40px"><img src="../images/mr2.jpg" alt="mr2" width="300" display="inline"></div>I learned to drive on a stick shift. My first car was a red two-seat '91 Toyota mr2 kinda like this here. My dad copped it for a quick 3k. He later sold it after I failed to communicate that it was the only vehicle I could ever love.

That's how I feel about Sinatra. Today I made my first deployable ruby app. It's no hot rod but it will get you from A to B. ([Jukebox](http://www.mycodinghoneymoon.dreamhosters.com/playlister_erb/index.html "Jukebox"))

Once I was done I understood how all the parts moved. I can conceptualize it and I can even draw an exploded diagram:

RIP. Tomorrow we start on Sinatra. I browsed some Sinatra apps on github to try to see how they work. The simplest example I could find is this blogging app called "Scanty, a really small blog." I tried drawing a diagram of this one too:
<br><br>

Needless to say, this diagram makes no sense... Nothing should be floating.

It'd kinda like I just built a lawn mower engine:

Then tried to understand a simple volvo engine:
<br><br>

...and realized I couldn't even find the starter.

At first I thought config.ru was the application file because it required 'main.' But apparently 'require' went the way of the carburetor. It looks like $LOAD_PATH is the current technology.

Not being able to find the starter is understable when the engine is packaged like this:

<br><br>

All I know right now is that Sinatra is doing some cloak-and-dagger behind-the-scenes shit. And I find that untrustworthy.

What happens if I choose not to use Sinatra?? Is there a steampunk movement in the Ruby community? If you're out there call me..
