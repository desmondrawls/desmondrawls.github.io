Recording with a light-second delay from basecamp at Mt. Ruby where all the rocks are gems and all the gems are mountains aka the origami forrest aka the blank screen factory aka the wind tunnel between your ears aka the what-are-you-waiting-for school of thought aka the solar-powered confidence summer jam aka The its-not-about-computers School aka the Flatiron School

'yield' is a keyword that appears in a method to pass a value to a yet-to-be-determined block of code. Trivial examples look like this:

def three_peat
  yield
  yield
  yield
end

three_peat {puts "hello world!"}
three_peat {puts "goodbye world!"}


def do_the_block (string)
  yield string
end

do_the_block ("what's going to happen to me?") {|this_string| puts this_string}
do_the_block ("i'm scared") {|bad_string| puts bad_string.split.insert(1,"not").insert(3, "anymore").join(" ")}
<br><br><br>
These are trivial examples because they could be re-written with no loss of key-strokes as:
<br><br><br>
3.times {puts "hello world!"}

3.times {puts "goodbye world!"}

puts "what's going to happen to me?"

"I'm scared".split.insert(1, "not").insert(3, "anymore").join(" ")


More worthwhile implementions of the yield keyword involve methods with more logic. For example:

class Email
  attr_accessor :sender, :recipient, :file

  def nsa
    f = File.open(self.file, "r")
    guilty = yield f
    f.close()
    if guilty
      puts "send #{self.sender} and #{self.recipient} to federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison"
    else
      puts "email is clean, tap the phones"
    end
  end

end

year_2013 = Email.new
year_2013.sender = "me"
year_2013.recipient = "little old lady"
year_2013.file = "/Hi_Grandma.pdf"

year_2013.nsa do |file|
  while line = file.gets
    if line == "Hi Grandma, I'm going to hijack a plane and fly it into the Pentagon"
      return true
    end
  end
  return false
end

year_2023 = Email.new
year_2023.sender = "me"
year_2023.recipient = "little old lady"
year_2023.file = "/Hi_Grandma.pdf"

year_2023.nsa do |file|
  while line = file.gets
    if line == "Hi Grandma, I'm sick of Christianity so I'm converting to Islam. I just thought you should know."
      return true
    end
  end
  return false
end

year_2033 = Email.new
year_2033.sender = "me"
year_2033.recipient = "little old lady"
year_2033.file = "/Hi_Grandma.pdf"

year_2033.nsa do |file|
  while line = file.gets
    if line == "Hi Grandma, this president sucks. ps Happy 106th bday!"
      return true
    end
  end
  return false
end


That's yield in action. It might feel like a slippery concept because it is. For those that learn from metaphors I came up with 5 that might help: 

Yield is the settings on your microwave. Like on mine i have "time defrost", "auto defrost", "reheat", "cook", "popcorn", "pizza", and "beverage."

Yield is the attachments on your kitchenaid food processor.

Yield is AutoTune.

Yield is tinted sunglasses.

Yield is that trick play from Little Giants.
